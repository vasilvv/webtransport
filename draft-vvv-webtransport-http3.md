--- abstract

WebTransport [OVERVIEW] is a protocol framework that enables clients
constrained by the Web security model to communicate with a remote server using
a secure multiplexed transport.  This document describes a WebTransport
protocol that is based on HTTP/3 [HTTP3] and provides support for
unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams and datagrams, all multiplexed
within the same HTTP/3 connection.

# Introduction

HTTP/3 [HTTP3] is a protocol defined on top of QUIC [QUIC-TRANSPORT] that can
multiplex HTTP requests over a QUIC connection.  This document defines
a mechanism for multiplexing non-HTTP data with HTTP/3 in a
manner that conforms with the WebTransport protocol requirements and semantics
[OVERVIEW].  Using the mechanism described here, multiple WebTransport
instances can be multiplexed simultaneously with regular HTTP traffic on the
same HTTP/3 connection.

## Terminology

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

This document follows terminology defined in Section 1.2 of [OVERVIEW].  Note
that this document distinguishes between a WebTransport server and an HTTP/3
server.  An HTTP/3 server is the server that terminates HTTP/3 connections; a
WebTransport server is an application that accepts WebTransport sessions, which
can be accessed via an HTTP/3 server.

# Protocol Overview

WebTransport servers in general are identified by a pair of authority value and
path value (defined in {{!RFC3986}} Sections 3.2 and 3.3 correspondingly).

When an HTTP/3 connection is established, both the client and server have to
send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT setting in order to indicate that they
both support WebTransport over HTTP/3.

WebTransport sessions are initiated inside a given HTTP/3 connection by the
client, who sends an extended CONNECT request {{!RFC8441}}.  If the server
accepts the request, an WebTransport session is established.  The resulting
stream will be further referred to as a *CONNECT stream*, and its stream ID is
used to uniquely identify a given WebTransport session within the connection.
The ID of the CONNECT stream that established a given WebTransport session will
be further referred to as a *Session ID*.

After the session is established, the peers can exchange data using the
following mechanisms:

* A client can create a bidirectional stream using a special indefinite-length
  HTTP/3 frame that transfers ownership of the stream to WebTransport.
* A server can create a bidirectional stream, which is possible since HTTP/3
  does not define any semantics for server-initiated bidirectional streams.
* Both client and server can create a unidirectional stream using a special
  stream type.
* A datagram can be sent using a QUIC DATAGRAM frame [QUIC-DATAGRAM].

An WebTransport session is terminated when the CONNECT stream that created it
is closed.

# Session Establishment

## Establishing a Transport-Capable HTTP/3 Connection

In WebTransport, an *exclusive mode* is a state of HTTP/3 connection where the
connection is expected to have exactly one WebTransport session, and no other
HTTP requests.

In order to indicate support for WebTransport, both the client and the server
MUST send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT setting.  The default value of
SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT is "0" (Unsupported), however it can also assume
values of "1" (Supported) and "2" (Exclusive).  The exact meaning of the value
depends on which endpoint is sending the setting.

SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT sent by the client has the following possible values:
* Unsupported ("0") indicates that the client does not support WebTransport
  over HTTP/3.
* Supported ("1") indicates that the client supports WebTransport over HTTP/3
  and may potentially initiate a WebTransport session in the future.
* Intended ("2") indicates that the client both supports WebTransport over
  HTTP/3 and has a WebTransport request that it intends to send over the
  connection in question.

SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT sent by the server has the following possible values:
* Unsupported ("0") indicates that the server does not support WebTransport
  over HTTP/3.
* Supported ("1") indicates that the server supports WebTransport over HTTP/3.
* Exclusive ("2") indicates that the server expects to handle exactly one
  request over the connection in question, and that request has to be a
  WebTransport session.

Once an HTTP/3 implementation has the SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT from both
sides, the following should happen:

* If one of client's or server's value is "0", and another value is either "0"
  or "1", the connection does not support WebTransport.
* If both server's value is "1", and client's value is "1" or "2", the
  connection supports WebTransport in normal mode.
* If server's value is "2", and client's value is "0" or "1", the connection
  MUST be closed with a connection error.
* If both client's and server's value is "2", the HTTP/3 connection operates in
  the exclusive mode.
* If client's value is "2", and server's value is "0", the WebTransport session
  that client intended to open will fail.  The client MAY close the connection
  with error, or it MAY keep it closed for regular HTTP use.

{: #fig-modes title="Meanings of SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT values"}

If SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT is negotiated, support for the QUIC DATAGRAMs
within HTTP/3 MUST be negotiated as described in
{{!HTTP3-DATAGRAM=I-D.schinazi-masque-h3-datagram}}; negotiating WebTransport
support without negotiating QUIC DATAGRAM extension SHALL result in a
H3_SETTINGS_ERROR error.

[HTTP3] requires client's `initial_max_bidi_streams` transport parameter to be
set to zero.  Existing implementation might enforce this requirement before
negotiating settings; thus, the client MUST send a non-zero MAX_STREAMS for
client-initiated bidirectional streams after receiving an appropriate SETTINGS
frame from the server.

## Extended CONNECT in HTTP/3

{{!RFC8441}} defines an extended CONNECT method in Section 4, enabled by the
SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL parameter.  That parameter is only defined for
HTTP/2.  This document does not create a new multi-purpose parameter to
indicate support for extended CONNECT in HTTP/3; instead, the
SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT setting implies that an endpoint supports extended
CONNECT.

## Creating a New Session

As WebTransport sessions are established over HTTP/3, they are identified
using the `https` URI scheme {{!RFC7230}}.

In order to create a new WebTransport session, a client can send an HTTP
CONNECT request.  The `:protocol` pseudo-header field ({{!RFC8441}}) MUST be
set to `webtransport`.  The `:scheme` field MUST be `https`.  Both the
`:authority` and the `:path` value MUST be set; those fields indicate the
desired WebTransport server.  An `Origin` header {{!RFC6454}} MUST be provided
within the request.

Upon receiving an extended CONNECT request with a `:protocol` field set to
`webtransport`, the HTTP/3 server can check if it has a WebTransport
server associated with the specified `:authority` and `:path` values.  If it
does not, it SHOULD reply with status code 404 (Section 6.5.4, {{!RFC7231}}).
If it does, it MAY accept the session by replying with status code 200.
The WebTransport server MUST verify the `Origin` header to ensure that the
specified origin is allowed to access the server in question.

From the client's perspective, a WebTransport session is established when the
client receives a 200 response.  From the server's perspective, a session is
established once it sends a 200 response.  Both endpoints MUST NOT open any
streams or send any datagrams on a given session before that session is
established.  WebTransport over HTTP/3 does not support 0-RTT.

## Limiting the Number of Simultaneous Sessions

From the flow control perspective, WebTransport sessions count against the
stream flow control just like regular HTTP requests, since they are established
via an HTTP CONNECT request.  This document does not make any effort to
introduce a separate flow control mechanism for sessions, nor to separate HTTP
requests from WebTransport data streams.  If the server needs to limit the rate
of incoming requests, it has alternative mechanisms at its disposal:

* `HTTP_REQUEST_REJECTED` error code defined in [HTTP3] indicates to the
  receiving HTTP/3 stack that the request was not processed in any way.
* HTTP status code 429 indicates that the request was rejected due to rate
  limiting {{!RFC6585}}.  Unlike the previous method, this signal is directly
  propagated to the application.

# WebTransport Features

WebTransport over HTTP/3 provides the following features described in [OVERVIEW]:
unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams and datagrams, initiated by
either endpoint.

Session IDs are used to demultiplex streams and datagrams belonging to different
WebTransport sessions.  On the wire, session IDs are encoded using the QUIC
variable length integer scheme described in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

## Unidirectional streams

Once established, both endpoints can open unidirectional streams.  The HTTP/3
unidirectional stream type SHALL be 0x54.  The body of the stream SHALL be the stream
type, followed by the session ID, encoded as a variable-length integer, followed
by the user-specified stream data ({{fig-unidi}}).

## Client-Initiated Bidirectional Streams

WebTransport clients can initiate bidirectional streams by opening an HTTP/3
bidirectional stream and sending an HTTP/3 frame with type
`WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM` (type=0x41).  The format of the frame SHALL be the frame
type, followed by the session ID, encoded as a variable-length integer,
followed by the user-specified stream data ({{fig-bidi-client}}).  The frame
SHALL last until the end of the stream.

## Server-Initiated Bidirectional Streams

WebTransport servers can initiate bidirectional streams by opening a
bidirectional stream within the HTTP/3 connection.  Note that since HTTP/3 does
not define any semantics for server-initiated bidirectional streams, this
document is a normative reference for the semantics of such streams for all
HTTP/3 connections in which the SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT option is negotiated.
The format of those streams SHALL be the session ID, encoded as a
variable-length integer, followed by the user-specified stream data
({{fig-bidi-server}}).

## Datagrams

Datagrams can be sent using the DATAGRAM frame as defined in [QUIC-DATAGRAM]
and [HTTP3-DATAGRAM].  For all HTTP/3 connections in which the
SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT option is negotiated, the Flow Identifier is set
to the session ID.  In other words, the format of datagrams SHALL be the
session ID, followed by the user-specified payload ({{fig-datagram}}).

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-datagram title="Datagram format"}

In QUIC, a datagram frame can span at most one packet.  Because of that, the
applications have to know the maximum size of the datagram they can send.
However, when proxying the datagrams, the hop-by-hop MTUs can vary.
TODO: Describe how the path MTU can be computed, specifically propagation across
HTTP proxies.

# Session Termination

An WebTransport session over HTTP/3 is terminated when either endpoint closes
the stream associated with the CONNECT request that initiated the session.
Upon learning about the session being terminated, the endpoint MUST stop
sending new datagrams and reset all of the streams associated with the session.

# Security Considerations

WebTransport over HTTP/3 satisfies all of the security requirements imposed by
[OVERVIEW] on WebTransport protocols, thus providing a secure framework for
client-server communication in cases when the client is potentially untrusted.

WebTransport over HTTP/3 requires explicit opt-in through the use of a QUIC
transport parameter; this avoids potential protocol confusion attacks by
ensuring the HTTP/3 server explicitly supports it.  It also requires the use of
the Origin header, providing the server with the ability to deny access to
Web-based clients that do not originate from a trusted origin.

Just like HTTP traffic going over HTTP/3, WebTransport pools traffic to different origins
within a single connection.  Different origins imply different trust domains,
meaning that the implementations have to treat each transport as potentially
hostile towards others on the same connection.  One potential attack is a
resource exhaustion attack: since all of the transports share both congestion
control and flow control context, a single client aggressively using up those
resources can cause other transports to stall.  The user agent thus SHOULD
implement a fairness scheme that ensures that each transport within connection
gets a reasonable share of controlled resources; this applies both to sending
data and to opening new streams.
